        <h4> This experiment is meant to check the stiffness of different types of clothes. In this experiment you will be shown triplets of small length videos one by one. The videos are 5-6 second in length. Clothes are subjected to  external agents like wind from different direction and the videos of their subsequent deformation recorded.</h2>


   
        <h4> There are 8 blocks in this entire experiment. There are 100 triplets of videos in total for each block. The middle video is the base video or the anchor video. You have to look at the right and left video and then decide on if the left video is more similar in stiffness to the centre video or the right one is more similar in stiffness to the centre one. Your response will be recorded. </h4>
        <h4> After filling in response for each video, press the next arrow button to move to next video.</h4>

        <h4> Kindly judge each and every video and don't skip any video. Kindly look at the motion of clothes before making any decision and don't just go by their visual appearance. </h4>

        <h4>The entire experiment takes around 40-50 minutes.</h4>

        <h4> When all the 100 triplets of  videos have been labelled, you will be moved to the the next block.</h4>

        <h4> Kindly write your name in the same way for each block</h4>
