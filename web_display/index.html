        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        
        <br>
   
        <p>This experiment is studying human perception of cloth stiffness. In this experiment you will be shown triplets of small length videos one by one. The videos are 5-6 seconds in length. In each trial, you are shown 3 videos. The middle video is the anchor video. The left video is cloth A, the right video is cloth B.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>You have to decide whether cloth A or cloth B has a <b>different</b> stiffness than the anchor. In other words, find the odd one out in stiffness. You will also be asked to rate the triplet from 0 to 10 based on how confident you were in your decision. 0 means you are completely confident that you were correct, while 10 means your choice was a complete guess. Use the Next button to see the next triplet of videos.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>At the start of each block, you will be prompted to enter your initials. Please enter them the same way evey time. At the end of each block, a new tab will open automatically and prompt you for your initials. When the experiment is over, a new tab will open telling you experiment is finished.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>You can take breaks between blocks (when a new tab opens and you are prompted for your initials, before the videos are displayed). However, we ask that you do not take a break in the middle of a block. There are 10 blocks in the entire experiment. There are 50 trials for each block. The entire experiment takes around 60 minutes.</p>
